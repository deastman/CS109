Data Science (CS109) at Harvard University, Fall '13

This course focused on methods for five key facets of an investigation: 
data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; data 
management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably; exploratory 
data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition; prediction based on 
statistical methods such as regression and classification; and communication 
of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.
